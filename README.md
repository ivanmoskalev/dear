# xn

xn is a (slowly) growing collection of Swift libraries for macOS and iOS, released into the public domain.

## Philosophy

Knowledge should be released into public domain as much as reasonably possible. These libraries are my way of sharing what I know with fellow engineers.

## Libraries

### [xn-swift](https://github.com/ivanmoskalev/xn-swift)
Swift language extensions and algorithms that are too general to warrant their own packages.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ivanmoskalev/xn-swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

### [xn-levenshtein](https://github.com/ivanmoskalev/xn-levenshtein)
Generic Levenshtein edit distance implementation with **O(n Ã— m)** time and **O(m)** space complexity.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ivanmoskalev/xn-levenshtein.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

## Under Construction

### [xn-kv](https://github.com/ivanmoskalev/xn-kv)
Key-value store based on LMDB.
